# Javascript Sudoku Puzzle Generator

A Pen created on CodePen.io. Original URL: [https://codepen.io/pavlovsk/pen/XmjPOE](https://codepen.io/pavlovsk/pen/XmjPOE).

In this demo, backtracking algorithm is used for generating the sudoku. Difficulty and solvability is totally random as I randomly left a number of hints from a full-filled board.
